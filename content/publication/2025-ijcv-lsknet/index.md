abstract: Remote sensing images pose distinct challenges for downstream tasks due to their inherent complexity. While a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to remote sensing classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and change detection, most of these studies have overlooked the valuable prior knowledge embedded within remote sensing scenarios. Such prior knowledge can be useful because remote sensing objects may be mistakenly recognized without referencing a sufficiently long-range context, which can vary for different objects. This paper considers these priors and proposes a lightweight Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet) backbone. LSKNet can dynamically adjust its large spatial receptive field to better model the ranging context of various objects in remote sensing scenarios. To our knowledge, large and selective kernel mechanisms have not been previously explored in remote sensing backbone design. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LSKNet across multiple remote sensing tasks.

summary: This paper proposes LSKNet, a lightweight backbone for remote sensing that leverages large selective kernels to dynamically adjust spatial receptive fields, improving performance across various remote sensing tasks.
