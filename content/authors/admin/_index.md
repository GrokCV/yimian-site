## About Me

I am currently an Associate Professor at the Visual Computing and Intelligent Perception (VCIP) Lab, College of Computer Science, Nankai University. I am proud to be a part of the team led by [Prof. Ming-Ming Cheng (程明明)](https://mmcheng.net/cmm/). Prior to this, I had the privilege of being a Postdoctoral Fellow at the PCA Lab, where I was fortunate to work under the guidance of [Prof. Jian Yang (杨健)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6CIDtZQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) from Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST). His mentorship was invaluable to my growth as a researcher.
